# NeuroScienceProject
This repository contains the code for the final project of the Introduction to Neuroscience course, including data processing, experiments, analysis, and visualization.

## Quickstart
Before running the code, make sure you have setup the environment and installed the required packages. 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
To run our experimental code, `cd NeuroScienceProject` directory and execute 
```
python mul-behavior-decision-making.py
``` 
The preprocessing and visualization code required during the experiment is located in the `script` folder.

All the modeling code is located in the `modeling` folder.

The experimental materials for video and audio are located in the `video_stim` and `audio_stim` folders.
